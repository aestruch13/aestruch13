## 🙋‍♂️ About me
- **Full name:** Alex Estruch Encinas  
- **Age:** 26  
- **Location:** Barcelona

## 💡 Concerns
📖 I started a degree in **Computer Engineering** at the [Universitat Oberta de Catalunya](https://www.uoc.edu/), where I am halfway through.  

🌱 I’m currently learning full stack development through a bootcamp.  

🧠 I'd like to dedicate myself to the world of **cybersecurity**, but since university is a slower path and you have to specialize later, I decided to get ahead. That's why I'm taking the **Full Stack Software Developer bootcamp** at [4Geeks Academy](https://4geeksacademy.com/). Right now, I'm focused on finishing the course and moving into the tech world professionally.  

🪐 In the future, I would like to specialize in **cybersecurity**.
